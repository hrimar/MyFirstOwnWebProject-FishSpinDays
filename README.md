FishSpinDays is my first own web project with roles - a blog for fishing stories and events.

The application is separated into areas with multiple layouts and accessible by users with different access level:
- All users could read all the available information, but they haven't permission to write anything.
- Only logged in users could write publications in sections chosen by dropdown list; to like a publications, but not their own publications; could make some comments and like or dislike comments; could use our real-time communication chat channel and use the API of the application.
- The admin of the application could create new main sections and subsections in publications of different types; could write publications and edit the existed ones; could delete the comments; could see the list of all users with his publications and make Ban of user.
